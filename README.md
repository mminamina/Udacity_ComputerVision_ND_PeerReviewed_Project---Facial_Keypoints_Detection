## ComputerVision PeerReviewed Project: Facial Keypoints Detection
Project 1: Facial Keypoints Detection
### Project Experience
This is the first computer vision project which allows me to apply deep learning computer vision architectures(using **Pytorch**) to build a facial keypoint detection system for
- tracking
- pose recognition
- filters
- emotion recognition
### Image Augmentation
Introduce generalization(randomness) to detect and learn structures.
### Transform Steps
Only the following transformation techniques were chosen to avoid unnecessary impacts on keypoints.

- **Rescale** to 250 for width and height
- **RandomCrop** to 224
- **Normalize & Convert ToTensor**

### Architecture & Performance
BatchSize, Epochs, Loss & Optimization Functions(only using **CPU**)

- **BatchSize** : 10 (notebook stopped working if used batchsize higher than 20)
- **Epochs**   : 8 (lower epochs was chosen due to hardware capacity constraint)
- **Loss**     : SmoothL1Loss (significant loss reduction since earlier epochs)
- **Optimizer** : Adam 

A simple model with 4 **Conv2D** layers, **ReLU** Activation, **MaxPooling**+**BatchNorm** in every layer, and **Dropout** to prevent overfitting.

### Worklist
For project instructions, please refer to https://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints
> The project is broken up into four Python notebooks; 
> only **Notebook 2, 3 and models.py** file are graded.
